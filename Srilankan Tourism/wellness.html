		 In the past people would travel places to explore new worlds, but in todays stressed out world, we travel places to treat ourselves, find out who we really are and do those things that make us truly happy.

		More and more travelers are seeking a new kind of break. Some like to call an escapade. But wellness tourism is a trend taking the industry by storm. By definition, wellness tourism is travel for the purpose of promoting one’s health and well-being through physical, psychological, or spiritual activities. Some like mindfulness and meditation while others yearn for energizing escapes.

		Sri Lanka has always been sought after for its pristine beaches, lush rainforests, Ayurvedic retreats and natural wonders. The common denominator in all of this is the opportunity to connect with Mother Nature. To be in oneness with the world we call home. Be it walking barefoot on the soft sandy soil or feeding orphaned elephants to living life as a recluse even if it means for a week.
		<br><br>
		Sri Lanka does not need to rebrand itself as a wellness destination because the distinction is clear. Most tourists who’ve been to Sri Lanka once are sure to recommend or return that is because it satisfies them in a way no other holiday does.
		<br><br>
		The World Health Organization defines wellness as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. It incorporates attitudes and activities that prevent disease, improve health, enhance the quality of life and bring a person to increasingly optimum levels of well-being.
		<br><br>
		The concept of wellness tourism dramatically broadens the appeal of medical tourism. Sri Lanka has been receiving medical tourists from Maldives, Seychelles, South Asian and African regions for its cost-effective treatments. There are two segments, global travelers who come there for cheaper medical service and other travelers from higher development index countries who seek preventive treatments to develop their personal wellbeing.
		<br><br>
		Sri Lanka has natural and traditional endowments that are used to foster a sustainable wellness tourism value chain that is deeply rooted in local communities and traditions. The growing number of activities, better accessibility, rise of new hotels and wellness tourism key reasons was one of the main reasons for Sri Lanka to be chosen for the top spot in the annual ‘Best in Travel 2019’ publication by Lonely Planet.
